This repository is to host publicly accessible projects made by me (Aditya Banerjee).

For now it has a simple stock market simulator game which is a remake of a web based simulator that I had built back in 2008 on Ruby on Rails for the Quadriga B-school competition in SJMSOM IIT Bombay. It has been reimagined as a single player game going up against AI players. Give it atry for some fun here - https://abaditya.github.io/QSE_Reloaded.html

This version is built in a monolithic HTML/CSS/JS file vibe coded with the help of Google Gemini and AI Studio after feeding it screen recording demos, rule documents and the original codebase.
